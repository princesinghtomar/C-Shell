# Shell
It's a shell

## Introduction
This is a very basic implementation of shell in C.

## Functionality
### Part1
 - [x] Support for semicolon seperated commands, not affected by whitespace
 - [x] Shell builtins: 
    - [x] `cd`
    - [x] `pwd`
    - [x] `echo`
    - [x] `exit`
    - [x] `history`
    - [x] `pinfo`
    - [x] `nightswatch`
    - [x] `ls -[al] [dirs..]`
 - [x] Execution of system commands with or without arguments, in background or foreground
 - [x] Notifying when and how the background process terminated
 - [x] *some other stuff else I didn't get the time to write because of the deadline*
### Part2
 - [x] Input and output redirection, including appending to a file
 - [x] Piping of commands
 - [x] Some more shell builtins:
    - [x] `setenv`
    - [x] `unsetenv`
    - [x] `jobs`
    - [x] `kjob`
    - [x] `fg`
    - [x] `bg`
    - [x] `overkill`
    - [x] `quit`
    - [x] `cronjob`
 - [x] Handling `SIGINT` [C-c] and `SIGTSTP` [C-z] signals
 - [x] Command recall using up arrow key
### Extras
 - [x] `echo` supports printing environment variables
 - [x] Spaces are escaped within quotes. i.e., `vim "bad name.txt"` will work as expected

## Build instructions
Simply run
```
$ make
$ ./Shell
```
If you want to see debug info, run
```
$ make debug
```
You'll see a lot of files. To remove them, you can run
```
$ make clean
```

## File structure
